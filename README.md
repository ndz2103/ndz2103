# Coursework

### Natural Language Processing 

Masters-level course that uses Python and associated packages pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit, nltk, and seaborn. Structure followed Natural Language Process from language acquisition and pre-processing to sentiment analysis and model creation. 

### Quantitative Theory and Methods

Masters-level course that teaches best practices of research design and methodology up to the data colleciton phase. Covers theory behind design and structure of research, while providing strengths and weaknesses to each methodolgy.

### Political Psychology

PhD-level course that reviews topics including political attitudes, prejudice and prejudice reduction, the influence of media, and voting behaviors and decision making. 

### Research Seminar

Masters-level seminar that exposes students to real-world applications of quantitative methods in the social sciences. Participated in weekly presentations by professionals and alumni regarding research, experience, and advice in their respective fields.

### Data Analysis for the Social Sciences

Masters-level course that covers data collection and analysis, and each analytical method's strengths and weaknesses. Learned and applied methodologies including linear, multivariate, logistic, and probabilitic regression. Also reviews bayesian statistics and data theory. 

# Research

## EPA 2023

There is an abundance of research demonstrating the connection between conservative ideology, religiosity, and anti-LGBT sentiment. However, there is inconclusive evidence indicating interventions to mitigate LGBT prejudice in conservativees and religious people. [Kalla & Broockman (2020)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4AA5B97806A4CAFBAB0651F5DAD8F223/S0003055419000923a.pdf/div-class-title-reducing-exclusionary-attitudes-through-interpersonal-conversation-evidence-from-three-field-experiments-div.pdf) show that open dialogue about transgender rights durably improves attitudes towards transgender people. However, discourse is not always possible. An alteernative intervention is intergroup contact [(Allport, 1954)](http://althaschool.org/_cache/files/7/1/71f96bdb-d4c3-4514-bae2-9bf809ba9edc/97F5FE75CF9A120E7DC108EB1B0FF5EC.holocaust-the-nature-of-prejudice.doc). This study explores how contact with LGBT people improve conservative and religious people's LGBT support. Results show that knowing an LGBT person improves LGBT sentiment, but not policy support.

### Rutgers University Psychology Honors Thesis

This study examines how cognitive complexity and prejudice influence perceptual preferences. Using a cognitive paradigm adapted from [Navon (1977)](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/0010028577900123?token=E18A18E4DD421BA86DE9DB44387E1160337FB5A974F0B812F94C8F6D3B7E4BA862A30532C0A7C631917A4A06734EA413&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20221207031905), this study shows that global stimuli, or stimuli manipulated on the largest level, were rated as more different than local stimuli, but those high in cognitive complexity and low and low in prejudice were more scrutinous of their appraisals, suggesting that type of thinking, not the amount of thinking, influences an individual's perceptual preferences.

### EPA 2022

This study examines the relationship between moral foundations and prejudice. Results showed types of morality associated with conservative ideology (e.g., ingroup loyalty, obedience to authority, and sanctity/purity) was predicted by lower cognitive complexity. Similarly, prejudice was predicted by moral sanctity and political conservatism. Interestingly, the strength of these relationships diminished when controlling with cognitive complexity, suggesting that the way we cognitively represent the world may guide our morality.
