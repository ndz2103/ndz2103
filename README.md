# Research

### SPSSI 2023

Research demonstrates the connection between conservative ideology, religiosity, and anti-LGBT sentiment. However, there is inconclusive evidence about interventions to mitigate LGBT prejudice in conservatives and religious people. [Kalla & Broockman (2020)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4AA5B97806A4CAFBAB0651F5DAD8F223/S0003055419000923a.pdf/div-class-title-reducing-exclusionary-attitudes-through-interpersonal-conversation-evidence-from-three-field-experiments-div.pdf) show that dialogue about transgender rights durably improves attitudes towards transgender people. Another intervention is intergroup contact [(Allport, 1954)](http://althaschool.org/_cache/files/7/1/71f96bdb-d4c3-4514-bae2-9bf809ba9edc/97F5FE75CF9A120E7DC108EB1B0FF5EC.holocaust-the-nature-of-prejudice.doc). This study explores how LGBT closeness improves conservative and religious <br> people's LGBT support. Results show that <br> LGBT closeness improves LGBT sentiment <br> and policy support.

### EPA 2023

In relation to my SPSSI 2023 research, this study explores how contact, not closeness, with LGBT people improves conservative and religious people's LGBT support. Results show that knowing an LGBT person improves LGBT sentiment, but not policy support. These findings suggest that having contact with LGBT people doesn't improve LGBT support, rather, people need to know them.

Understanding the mechanisms behind unconscious bias may allow us to develop intervention to decrease prejudice. Using a cognitive paradign derived from [Navon (1977)](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/0010028577900123?token=E18A18E4DD421BA86DE9DB44387E1160337FB5A974F0B812F94C8F6D3B7E4BA862A30532C0A7C631917A4A06734EA413&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20221207031905), this study provides preliminary evidence that perceptual preferencees may relate to prejudice and cogntitive complexity. Results show that global stimuli, or stimuli manipulated on the largest level, were rated as more different than local stimuli, but those high in cognitive complexity and low and low in prejudice were more scrutinous of their <br> appraisals.

This study examines the relationship between moral foundations and prejudice. Results showed types of morality associated with conservative ideology was predicted by lower cognitive complexity. Similarly, prejudice was predicted by moral sanctity and political conservatism. Results showed that the strength of these relationships diminished when controlling with cognitive complexity, suggesting <br> that the way we cognitively represent the world may guide our morality.
